Blockstack is shorthand for "the blockchain stack". It is a collection of protocols and applications that can be used for building blockchain applications.

The various components include data storage, secure naming, authentication, user identity verification, content ownership verification, and product trading.

This stack is completely decentralized and only uses open source software.
