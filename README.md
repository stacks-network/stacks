Blockstack is shorthand for "the blockchain stack". It is a collection of protocols and applications that can be used for building blockchain-powered decentralized applications. A group of blockchain companies and nonprofits are coming together to define and develop Blockstack.

The various components include data storage, secure naming, authentication, user identity verification, content ownership verification, and product trading. 

This stack is completely decentralized and only uses open source software.
