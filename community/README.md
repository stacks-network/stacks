### Spread the word

* Podcasts - Appearing on Podcasts is a great way to activate the developer community. If you know of a developer-docused podcast that gets more than a few thousand views per episode, feel free to reach out to them and suggest Blockstack make an appearance. Here's one that worked well, [The Lunduke Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1fThdPbAEA&t=226s).
* Conferences - Blockstack is happy to keynote conferences that attract: Fullstack developers, Front end developers, cypherpunks, identity, and folks interested in the decentralized space. Feel free to submit applications for outstanding conferences on our behalf using info from the [Bios page](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack/blob/master/media/bios.md)
* Email Sign Up - Have people sign up using the [Developer Sign Up page](https://blockstack.org/developers) for devs and the [User Waitlist Signup page](https://blockstack.org/users) for non-devs
